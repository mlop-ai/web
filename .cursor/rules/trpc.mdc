# TRPC V11

We are using trpc v11 not v10 there has been a different way of performing queries and mutations. In trpc v10 you did

```ts
trpc.greeting.useQuery({ name: 'Jerry' })
```

Now in V11 you use

```ts
useQuery(trpc.greeting.queryOptions({ name: 'Jerry' }))
```

Using useQuery from tanstack query
The same goes for mutations where you now use `useMutation`
